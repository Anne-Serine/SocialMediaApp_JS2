**This project is a JavaScript front-end client for a social media platform, implementing various features for users to interact with the platform's content, such as registering, logging in, viewing, posting, editing, and deleting social media content.**

## Website architecture:

## Built With:

- HTML
- SCSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Noroff API v2

## Features

**The client application includes the following features:**

- **User Registration:** Users with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email addresses can register their profiles.
- **User Login:** Registered users can log in to their accounts.
- **Post Content Feed:** Users can view a feed of post content items.

## API Integration

The client application utilizes the Noroff API v2 to communicate with the backend server. It requires both a JWT token and an API Key for authentication and authorization. Users need to register an account and login to access their token. The application utilizes HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to communicate with the API endpoints.
